# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-ML
Used LSTM machine learning model to predict Mahindra’s (MM) stock price

We used the LSTM Machine Learning Model 
LSTM – Long Short Term Memory. 
It is a kind of recurrent neural network where the last step is fed as the input in the current step.
It is used for processing , predicting and classifying on the basis of time-series data.

We have commented the code so you can step by step understand , We have divided the code into 5 parts 
1. We collected data from Yahoo Finance
2. Preprocessed the data - Divided into train and test 
3. Created An Stack LSTM Model with the method being 'root-squared-mean'' and optimization technique being 'adam'
4. Predicted the test data and plotted the output
5. Predicted for the future 30 days
